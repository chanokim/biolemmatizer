This INSTALL file describes how to build the BioLemmatizer project. If you are
simply looking to use the BioLemmatizer, then either add the following Maven 
dependency coordinates and repository configuration to your 
pom file (if you are using Maven):

<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.ucdenver.ccp</groupId>
  <artifactId>biolemmatizer-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.ucdenver.ccp</groupId>
  <artifactId>biolemmatizer-uima</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>bionlp-sourceforge</id>
  <url>http://bionlp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bionlp/repo/</url>
</repository>

or, if you are not using Maven, download the BioLemmatizer binary from 
http://bionlp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bionlp/repo/edu/ucdenver/ccp/biolemmatizer/1.0/biolemmatizer-core-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
and place it on your classpath.

Note: The BioLemmatizer code requires Java version 6 or greater.

If you are interested in building the BioLemmatizer project locally, please 
read on. There are at least two options for building the BioLemmatizer project:

Option 1: Import the BioLemmatizer into Eclipse as a Maven project. Included in 
          the distribution are the .project and .classpath files used by Eclipse
          to configure Eclipse projects. Once the BioLemmatizer project has been
          imported into Eclipse, Run As --> Maven install will build the 
          project. Note, building Maven projects inside of Eclipse requires 
          installation of a plugin. For details see: 
                                     http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html
                                      
Option 2: Build from the command line using Maven
           Requirements:
                         Apache Maven 3.0.3 (http://maven.apache.org/)
                         Java 1.6.x

           Inside the base biolemmatizer/ directory, execute: mvn clean install

If you are not familiar with Maven, you can find the build artifacts 
(e.g. jar files, etc.) in the target/ directories inside each Maven module, 
i.e. biolemmatizer-core/target/ and biolemmatizer-uima/target/.
