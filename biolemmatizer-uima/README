The biolemmatizer-uima module implements a UIMA Analysis Engine (AE) 
incorporating the lemmatization functionality present in the biolemmatizer-core 
module. The AE class is edu.ucdenver.ccp.nlp.biolemmatizer.uima.BioLemmatizer_AE

A typical usage scenario for this AE will be to consume token annotations from 
the CAS, lemmatize their covered text, and add the lemmas to the CAS.

Efforts have been made to make this AE as type-system-independent as possible, 
allowing for easy integration in any NLP pipeline. This project makes use of the
UIMA-SHIMS project (part of http://bionlp-uima.sourceforge.net/) which provides
some simple interfaces for common tasks performed by AEs. Using implementations
of these interfaces makes the AE quite flexible in regards to working with 
various type systems. 

There are also options that allow for the AE to be configured to use a specific
class from the CAS as the token class, and optionally a specific method name 
from which to extract part of speech information. 

The configuration scenarios are documented in the unit tests (see src/test/java)
that accompany this distribution:
 
BioLemmatizer_AE_Default_Test.java 
  - demonstrates the simplest setup that uses the token class name as input to 
    specify token annotations in the CAS.
   
BioLemmatizer_AE_ReInsert_Test.java
  - demonstrates implementation of the LemmaDecorator interface to customize 
    how the lemmas are stored in the CAS once they are determined.
    
BioLemmatizer_AE_CustomTypes_Test.java
  - demonstrates the full flexibility of the BioLemmatizer_AE to interact a
    type system
    

---- CONFIGURATION/DESCRIPTOR FILES ----
The biolemmatizer-uima module uses the 
UimaFIT (http://code.google.com/p/uimafit/) library. If you are interested in
using the BioLemmatizer_AE in the context of UimaFIT, the test cases are also
a good place to look for examples.

For convenience, we have included several UIMA descriptor files with this 
distribution. They can be found in 
src/main/resources/edu/ucdenver/ccp/nlp/biolemmatizer/uima
Descriptions of each can be found in the README_DESCRIPTOR_FILES file found in
the same directory.
