The BioLemmatizer_AE is highly configurable in regards to the UIMA types it 
uses. Three example descriptor files are included in the distribution. A brief 
description for each follows. Look at the overview in each individual descriptor
file for more details.

BioLemmatizer_AE_TokenClsInput_NoPOS.xml
This descriptor file demonstrates how you can provide the class name of a token
annotation that exists in the CAS, 
e.g. "edu.ucdenver.ccp.nlp.biolemmatizer.uima.test.Token", and run the 
BioLemmatizer_AE. This particular setup assumes no part-of-speech information is
present. Note, as a result of missing part-of-speech information, the 
BioLemmatizer may return multiple lemma/part-of-speech pairs depending on the 
input.

BioLemmatizer_AE_TokenClsInput_WithPOS.xml
This descriptor is a minor extension of the one described above. If your type
system happens to store part-of-speech tags as a String in a field attached to
the token annotation, then this descriptor will allow you to use the 
BioLemmatizer_AE directly with your type system, no coding necessary, by simply
indicating the method name used to extract the part-of-speech tag from the 
token.

BioLemmatizer_AE_CustomSettings.xml
This descriptor demonstrates the full flexibility of the BioLemmatizer_AE to 
deal with various type systems. By utilizing a series of simple interfaces, the
BioLemmatizer is able to extract the information it requires from the CAS and
insert the resulting lemmas into the CAS. This descriptor requires the most 
configuration and will likely require some coding to interface with your type 
system, but again is the most flexible.
